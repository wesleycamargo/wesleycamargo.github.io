Welcome to my blog! This is my first post using Hugo with the Stack theme.

## About This Site

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and modern static site generator written in Go. I'm using the beautiful [Stack theme](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) which provides a clean and responsive design.

## Features

The Stack theme comes with many great features:

- **Responsive design** - Works great on desktop and mobile
- **Dark mode support** - Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Search functionality** - Find content quickly
- **Tag cloud** - Explore content by tags
- **Archive** - Browse posts chronologically
- **Table of contents** - Navigate long posts easily

## Getting Started

To create your own Hugo site with the Stack theme:

1. Install Hugo
2. Create a new Hugo site
3. Add the Stack theme
4. Configure your site
5. Create content
6. Build and deploy

Thank you for visiting my blog! I hope you enjoy the content and the beautiful Stack theme.
